Provide basic information about your dataset in this section. If you selected your own dataset, make sure you note the source of your data and summarize any data wrangling steps that you performed before you started your exploration.


## Summary of Findings

> A loan status of Alpha C is the most common, also most loans are listed under debt consolidation (Debt consolidation is a form of money management where you pay off existing debts by taking out one new loan). 
The ProsperScore does not match the code in dataset making me to believe there is an error in collation with an addition of 1. since the highest score is meant to be 10..

Also most borrower's have an income range betwwen 25000- 50000 dollars.

Summarize all of your findings from your exploration here, whether you plan on bringing them into your explanatory presentation or not.


## Key Insights for Presentation

> In the presentation, I start by introducing the dataset and the sub-section I worked on. Then  I  show the distribution of Prosper rating and show the most common rating alphabet. I  go on to answer the question on if borrower's own a home and show a pie chart to give a rough estimate of the percentage of home owners. I display a distribution of Loan status and employment status to give an idea of just how many listings are completed and how common employed people list a loan. 
Move on to show the most popular reason for listing a loan. I round it up with a boxplot comparing imcome range and the original amount borrowed.
